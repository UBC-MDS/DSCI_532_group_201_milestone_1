# Project Proposal: Natural Disasters And Their Impact Across The World

## Motivation and purpose

Every year natural disasters kill many people across the world. Natural disasters are of various forms and different disasters create different challenges for mankind. As it is said "prevention is better than cure", if we have information about which disaster is most life-threatening, it will help us to be better prepared against that natural disaster. Studying the distribution of the disaster across the world will help us to identify the critical regions so that the government, as well as people of those regions, would be able to take preventive measures to minimize the loss of life.

To address this problem, we will create a dashboard where the user would be able to visually analyze which disaster is most life-threatening. The user would also be able to identify the regions which are most impacted by the disaster on a world map. The user would be able to vary the year to see the changes in the distribution of the disaster overtime on the map. The dashboard will also allow the user to click on any country and see the trend of the natural disaster over the years. To understand the extent of damage caused by the disaster, the user will have an option to select a particular year to see how many people died due to the natural disaster analyzed. 

## Data Description

We will first be analyzing data for all natural disasters on a global scale from the `global_data.csv`. This dataset contains information for 9 types of disasters stored in the variable `Entity`. More specifically, we will be comparing impacts caused by drought, earthquake, extreme temperature, extreme weather, flood, landslide, mass movement, volcanic activity, and wildfire. Time of the records are stored in the variable `Year` and maximum year range for all disasters is from 1900 to 2018. Each disaster in each year has 2 associated variables that describe statistics of the events: number of deaths (`Deaths`) and count of the disaster (`Counts`). Using this data we will also derive a new variable, named `death_per_event`, which is the number of death per occurrence of an event. We will be using another wrangled dataset named `earthquake_data.csv` containing specifically earthquake information from 1990 to 2017. This dataset is on a country level compared to the other global disaster dataset. Columns `Country` and `Code` contains the country names and codes which will be used for choropleth mapping on a world map. Annual number of people died from an earthquake and total number of people died in each country are stored in columns `Death_earthquake` and `Death_total` respectively. We will be using death rate in our analysis so another new variable `Death_rate` will be derived from these two columns. Most of the data come from the website [ourworldindata.org](https://ourworldindata.org/) and annual total number of death for each country is from [Global Health Data Exchange](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/).
