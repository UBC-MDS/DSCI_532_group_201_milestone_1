# Project Proposal: Natural Disasters and their impact across the world

## Motivation and purpose

Every year natural disasters kill many people across the world.Natural disasters are of various forms and different disasters create different challenges for mankind. As it is said "prevention is better than cure", if we have information about which disaster is most life threatening, it will help us to be better prepared against that natural disaster. Studying the distribution of the disaster across the world will help us to identify the critical regions so that the government as well as people of those regions would be able to take preventive measures to minimize the loss of life.

To address this problem, we will create a dashboard where the user would be able to visually analyze which disaster is most life threatening. The user would also be able to identify the regions which are most impacted by the disaster on a world map. The user would be able to vary the year to  see the changes in distribution of the disaster over time on the map. The dashboard will also allow the user to click on any country and see the trend of the natural disaster over the years. To understand the extent of damage caused by the disaster, the user will have an option to select a particular year to see how many people died due to the natural disaster analyzed.
