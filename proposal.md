# Project Proposal: Natural Disasters and their impact across the world

## Motivation and purpose

Every year natural disasters kill many people across the world.Natural disasters are of various forms and different disasters create different challenges for mankind. As it is said "prevention is better than cure", if we have information about which disaster is most threatening to humans, it will help us to be better prepared against that natural disaster which in turn will save many lives across the planet. Studying the distribution of the disaster across the world will help us identify the critical regions and the government as well as people of those regions would be able to take preventive measures to minimize loss of life.

For this we will be creating a dashboard which will show which disaster causes most number of deaths per occurence
