# Reflections on Natural Disaster Dash App

## Overall Comments
- Overall this dashboard is clearly organized and straightforward to users who are curious about natural disasters, especially earthquakes, happened in the recent past. We have integrated a lot of data and tailored interactions in our graphs to provide users insights into these events.

## Limitations and Future Improvements
- On this dashboard we focuses on visualizing impacts of earthquakes rather than providing a comprehensive view of all natural disasters due to data limitation. If we had enough country-level data, we could have created a more informative dashboard on which users are able to navigate to a certain disaster of interest.
- If time permitted, we could have included more detailed information on the dashboard, for example about some significant events, to provide users more context around this natural disaster topic as opposed to just presenting the graphs.
