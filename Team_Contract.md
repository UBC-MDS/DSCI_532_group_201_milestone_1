1. Meet once or twice a week after lab to work on the project together if needed (theoretically Monday

2. Once we have a general template of what we want to do, split the work so everyone is on the same
page (no overlap ...etc).
3. Communicate using Slack.
4. Implement feedback from teammates and TAs.
5. Everyone is flexible to take up additional tasks if needed.
6. Have fun!
