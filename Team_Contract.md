# Team Contract
<br>

- Meet once or twice a week after lab to work on the project together if needed (theoretically Monday
and Wednesday).

- Once we have a general template of what we want to do, split the work so everyone is on the same
page (no overlap ...etc).

- Communicate using Slack.

- Implement feedback from teammates and TAs.

- Everyone is flexible to take up additional tasks if needed.

- Have fun!

- Sunday doesn't work for Jack since he has to chill.

- Saturday doesn't work for Jasmine since she has to chill as well.

- Sunday doesn't work for Karanpal since he wants to go hiking.

- No meeting at bars.
