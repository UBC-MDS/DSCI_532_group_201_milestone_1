# Reflections

## Areas where our app does well:
- The colors used is very good. It is color-blind people friendly.
- Font size is good. It is of readable size.
- Axis labels are well choosen, they are very representative of what is being plotted.
- Line width is very good, can see from a distance.
- Plot sizes are good, they take up the majority of the screen.
- Plots are simple and to the point, answers the research question very directly.

## Limitations of our app:
- Some countries in the world map plot have missing data, they appear as blank. This makes the overall plot kind of confusing.
<br>
- Only earthquakes analyzed, it is not descriptive of all natural disasters in the world. 
<br>
- Log scale of bottom left changes with the year. This makes it hard to compare the severity of earthquakes between countries using color. Since the same color can mean two different numbers.
  
## Future Improvements and Additions:
- Can add data about other disasters, and see if differnt types of natural diasters are correlated to each other.
<br>
- Upon selecting a type of natural disaster, the plot on the top right would change accordingly to reflect that disaster type.
<br>
- Can apply LOESS (locally estimated scatterplot smoothing) or LOWESS (locally weighted scatterplot smoothing) to help plot the trend of a type of diaster over time.
<br>
- Change the log scale of the bottom left graph to be fixed.
<br>
- Can add outlines to every country, this resolves concern of countries with no data.
